# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: May 4th, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a simple program I can include as a module to put at the end of code to signal victory moving forward

**Thoughts** I'm at a point in my life where if I want to make significant changes to an aspect of my life, I am going to have to dedicate time and effort to doing it as opposed to half assing it and getting by. I want to use the 100 Days challenge as a way to work on my self discipline. 

I figured I would try to put together something fun to help set the tone of my 100 days. created a little victory module that plays a pretty funny sound bite from Talladega Night: The Ballad oif Ricky Bobby so I can call it at the end of different programs and projects moving forward to help motivate me. I also included a "Family Friendly" flag so that if others want to use it with a more appropriate sound, they can without having to find a new file.
